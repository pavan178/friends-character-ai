# Friends Character AI

In this coursework, the objective is to create a vector representation of the dialogue spoken by each character in the Friends script data. The aim is to enhance this representation such that each character's vector is distinct from others, enabling effective classification of documents by a simple information retrieval method. This classification will involve determining which character spoke the lines based on the similarity of their document vectors to those established during training.
